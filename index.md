## Project 1

[Analysis of High School Graduation Rates](danjos2.github.io/project1.md) 
This project focuses on how different socioeconomic factors influence high school graduation rates. I specifically looked at the percent of people holding a bachelor's degree, household income, unemployment, and families with children in poverty. Montgomery County Public School System was the study area.
