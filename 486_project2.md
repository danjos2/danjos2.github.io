## Description

I plan on doing an analysis of COVID-19 cases and access to health care facilities in Texas. More than 3 millions residents in rural communities throughout Texas have little to no access to proper health care facilities. The goal of this project is to show the spatial distribution of hospitals in Texas and how far residents with COVID-19 in rural communities have to travel to get this supportive care. 



## Data
The Texas county boundaries shapefile was obtained from the [Texas Department of Transportation website](https://gis-txdot.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/8b902883539a416780440ef009b3f80f_0) . COVID-19 data was obtained from the New York Times [ongoing repository](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data) of data on coronavirus cases and deaths in the United States. 
Since it was a raw CSV of all U.S. county-level data, I had to import the NYT data into R to properly filter. You can look at my process in Rstudio [here](cortest/subset_rstudio.nb.html) to see how I subsetted the data to show only Texas counties.
