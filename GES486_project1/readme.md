Topic:
 I will be comparing one of Maryland's best public school districts, Howard County Public Schools, to its worse school district, Baltimore City Public Schools. I am specifically looking at what factors influence high school graduation rates.  

Data: 
1.Maryland physical county boundary shapefile. 
2. Baltimore City High Schools shapefile
3. Howard County High Schools shapefile
4. Maryland census data shapefile and spreadsheet
5. Maryland high school graduation rate spreadsheet

Possible factors Data:
College attainment, income, demographics, poverty, community involvement, internet connectivity,and  walkability.


Note: 
1-4 can be obtained from Maryland's GIS Data Catalog https://data.imap.maryland.gov/ .
5-6 can be obtained from Marylandâ€™s Open Data Portal https://opendata.maryland.gov/


Subsets:
All data needs to be between 2010-2018 


Analysis and Output: 

There should be a map for each factor looking at a possible correlation between that and graduation rates. Then a final map that compares both school districts data. I will also make some graphs and plots in R to support my analysis
